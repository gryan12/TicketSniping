    "readme": "# react-router\n\nDeclarative routing for [React](https://facebook.github.io/react).\n\n## Installation\n\nUsing [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):\n\n    $ npm install --save react-router\n\n**Note:** This package provides the core routing functionality for React Router, but you might not want to install it directly. If you are writing an application that will run in the browser, you should instead install `react-router-dom`. Similarly, if you are writing a React Native application, you should instead install `react-router-native`. Both of those will install `react-router` as a dependency.\n\nThen with a module bundler like [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/), use as you would anything else:\n\n```js\n// using ES6 modules\nimport { Router, Route, Switch } from \"react-router\";\n\n// using CommonJS modules\nvar Router = require(\"react-router\").Router;\nvar Route = require(\"react-router\").Route;\nvar Switch = require(\"react-router\").Switch;\n```\n\nThe UMD build is also available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com):\n\n```html\n<script src=\"https://unpkg.com/react-router/umd/react-router.min.js\"></script>\n```\n\nYou can find the library on `window.ReactRouter`.\n\n## Issues\n\nIf you find a bug, please file an issue on [our issue tracker on GitHub](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/issues).\n\n## Credits\n\nReact Router is built and maintained by [React Training](https://reacttraining.com).\n",
